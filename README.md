# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Horse_Racing_Analysis
In this repository, I conduct an analysis on horse racing data with Supervised Machine Learning to create a predictive model that is optimized for being profitable in the long run. That is to say, betting on the horses chosen by this model will produce a stable profit once a statistically significant number of races are bet on.

The dataset is collected from Woodbine horseracing and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/noqcks/woodbine-races
